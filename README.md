## Project Description
CHUP is a web-based panic alert system for friend groups to instantly shut up when someone’s parents are calling. One press of the big red button and everyone’s devices scream "അമ്മ വിളി!" — saving you from awkward conversations and premature grounding.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
You’re in a group call, swearing like a sailor, when suddenly your mom calls. Your friends keep roasting you, she overhears, and suddenly your weekend plans are gone.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- A real-time “SHUT UP” alert:

- Big red CHUP button for instant chaos

- Loud panic sounds & flashing warnings

- Optional vibration to scare friends into silence

- Tracks the Mama’s Boy leaderboard for public shaming
